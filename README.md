# NumPyCNN: Implementing Convolutional Neural Networks From Scratch
NumPyCNN is a Python implementation for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) from scratch using NumPy. 

**IMPORTANT** *If you are coming for the code of the tutorial titled [Building Convolutional Neural Network using NumPy from Scratch]( [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/building-convolutional-neural-network-using-numpy-from-ahmed-gad](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/building-convolutional-neural-network-using-numpy-from-ahmed-gad/)), then it has been moved to the [TutorialProject](https://github.com/ahmedfgad/NumPyCNN/tree/master/TutorialProject) directory on 20 May 2020.*

The project has a single module named `cnn.py` which implements all classes and functions needed to build the CNN.

It is very important to note that the project only implements the **forward pass** of training CNNs and there is **no learning algorithm used**. Just the learning rate is used to make some changes to the weights after each epoch which is better than leaving the weights unchanged.

# Tutorials

There are different resources that can be used to get started with the building CNN and its Python implementation. 

## 1. Build Neural Networks in Python

Read about building neural networks in Python through the tutorial titled [**Artificial Neural Network Implementation using NumPy and Classification of the Fruits360 Image Dataset**](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/artificial-neural-network-implementation-using-numpy-fruits360-gad) available at these links:

## 2. Building CNN in Python

To start with coding the genetic algorithm, you can check the tutorial titled [**Building Convolutional Neural Network using NumPy from Scratch**](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/building-convolutional-neural-network-using-numpy-from-ahmed-gad) available at these links:

- [GitChat](https://gitbook.cn/gitchat/activity/5fddbca4201c01667e62c3c4)

[This tutorial](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/building-convolutional-neural-network-using-numpy-from-ahmed-gad)) is prepared based on a previous version of the project but it still a good resource to start with coding CNNs.
